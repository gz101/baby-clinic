# Baby Clinic
My version of the canonical [Spring Pet Clinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) project...except its for babies rather than pets.

I am using this project to practice `SpringBoot`, TDD with `JUnit5` and `Mockito`, agile development with `GitHub Issues`, and CI with `CircleCI`.
